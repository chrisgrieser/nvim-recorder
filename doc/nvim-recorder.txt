FEATURES                               *nvim-recorder-nvim-recorder--features*

- **Simplified controls**One key to start and stop recording, a second key for
    playing the macro. Instead of `qa … q @a @@`, you just do `q … q Q Q`.
- **Macro Breakpoints** for easier debugging of macros. Breakpoints can also be
    set after the recording and are automatically ignored when triggering a macro
    with a count.
- **Status line components**Particularly useful if you use `cmdheight=0` where
    the recording status is not visible.
- **Macro-to-Mapping**Copy a macro, so you can save it as a mapping.
- **Various quality-of-life features**notifications with macro content, the
    ability to cancel a recording, a command to edit macros,
- **Performance Optimizations for large macros**When the macro is triggered
    with a high count, temporarily enable some performance improvements.
- Uses up-to-date nvim features like `vim.notify`. This means you can get
    confirmation notices with plugins like
    nvim-notify <https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify>.


SETUP                                     *nvim-recorder-nvim-recorder--setup*


INSTALLATION ~

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder",
        dependencies = "rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- optional
        opts = {}, -- required even with default settings, since it calls `setup()`
    },
    
    -- packer
    use {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder",
        requires = "rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- optional
        config = function() require("recorder").setup() end,
    }
<

Calling `setup()` (or `lazy`’s `opts`) is **required**.


CONFIGURATION ~

>lua
    -- default values
    require("recorder").setup {
        -- Named registers where macros are saved (single lowercase letters only).
        -- The first register is the default register used as macro-slot after
        -- startup.
        slots = { "a", "b" },
    
        mapping = {
            startStopRecording = "q",
            playMacro = "Q",
            switchSlot = "<C-q>",
            editMacro = "cq",
            deleteAllMacros = "dq",
            yankMacro = "yq",
            -- ⚠️ this should be a string you don't use in insert mode during a macro
            addBreakPoint = "##",
        },
    
        -- Clears all macros-slots on startup.
        clear = false,
    
        -- Log level used for non-critical notifications; mostly relevant for nvim-notify.
        -- (Note that by default, nvim-notify does not show the levels `trace` & `debug`.)
        logLevel = vim.log.levels.INFO, -- :help vim.log.levels
    
        -- If enabled, only essential notifications are sent.
        -- If you do not use a plugin like nvim-notify, set this to `true`
        -- to remove otherwise annoying messages.
        lessNotifications = false,
    
        -- Use nerdfont icons in the status bar components and keymap descriptions
        useNerdfontIcons = true,
    
        -- Performance optimizations for macros with high count. When `playMacro` is
        -- triggered with a count higher than the threshold, nvim-recorder
        -- temporarily changes changes some settings for the duration of the macro.
        performanceOpts = {
            countThreshold = 100,
            lazyredraw = true, -- enable lazyredraw (see `:h lazyredraw`)
            noSystemClipboard = true, -- remove `+`/`*` from clipboard option
            autocmdEventsIgnore = { -- temporarily ignore these autocmd events
                "TextChangedI",
                "TextChanged",
                "InsertLeave",
                "InsertEnter",
                "InsertCharPre",
            },
        },
    
        -- [experimental] partially share keymaps with nvim-dap.
        -- (See README for further explanations.)
        dapSharedKeymaps = false,
    }
<

If you want to handle multiple macros or use `cmdheight=0`, it is recommended
to also set up the status line components:


STATUS LINE COMPONENTS ~

>lua
    -- Indicates whether you are currently recording. Useful if you are using
    -- `cmdheight=0`, where recording-status is not visible.
    require("recorder").recordingStatus()
    
    -- Displays non-empty macro-slots (registers) and indicates the selected ones.
    -- Only displayed when *not* recording. Slots with breakpoints get an extra `#`.
    require("recorder").displaySlots()
<


  [!TIP] Use with the config `clear = true` to see recordings you made this
  session.
Example for adding the status line components to lualine
<https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim>

>lua
    lualine_y = {
        { require("recorder").displaySlots },
    },
    lualine_z = {
        { require("recorder").recordingStatus },
    },
<


  [!TIP] Putthe components in different status line segments, so they have a
  different color, making the recording status more distinguishable from saved
  recordings

BASIC USAGE                         *nvim-recorder-nvim-recorder--basic-usage*

- `startStopRecording`Starts recording to the current macro slot (so you do
    not need to specify a register). Press again to end the recording.
- `playMacro`Plays the macro in the current slot (without the need to specify
    a register).
- `switchSlot`Cycles through the registers you specified in the configuration.
    Also show a notification with the slot and its content. (The currently
    selected slot can be seen in the |nvim-recorder-status-line-component|.)
- `editMacro`Edit the macro recorded in the active slot. (Be aware that these
    are the keystrokes in "encoded" form.)
- `yankMacro`Copies the current macro in decoded form that can be used to
    create a mapping from it. Breakpoints are removed from the copied macro.
- `deleteAllMacros`Copies the current macro in decoded form that can be used to


  [!TIP] For recursive macros (playing a macro inside a macro), you can still use
  the default command `@a`.

ADVANCED USAGE                   *nvim-recorder-nvim-recorder--advanced-usage*


PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS ~

Running macros with a high count can be demanding on the system and result in
lags. For this reason, `nvim-recorder` provides some performance optimizations
that are temporarily enabled when a macro with a high count is run.

Note that these optimizations do have some potential drawbacks. -
|`lazyredraw`| disables redrawing of the screen, which makes it harder to
notice edge cases not considered in the macro. It may also appear as if the
screen is frozen for a while. - Disabling the system clipboard is mostly safe,
if you do not intend to copy content to it with the macro. - Ignoring
auto-commands is not recommended, when you rely on certain plugin functionality
during the macro, since it can potentially disrupt those plugins’ effect.


MACRO BREAKPOINTS ~

`nvim-recorder` allows you to set breakpoints in your macros which can be
helpful for debugging macros. Breakpoints are automatically ignored when you
trigger the macro with a count.

**Setting Breakpoints** - _During a recording:_ press the `addBreakPoint` key
(default: `##`) in normal mode - _After a recording:_ use `editMacro` and add
or remove the `##` manually.

**Playing Macros with Breakpoints** - Using the `playMacro` key, the macro
automatically stops at the next breakpoint. The next time you press
`playMacro`, the next segment of the macro is played. - Starting a new
recording, editing a macro, yanking a macro, or switching macro slot all reset
the sequence, meaning that `playMacro` starts from the beginning again.


  [!TIP] You can do other things in between playing segments of the macro, like
  moving a few characters to the left or right. That way you can also use
  breakpoints to manually correct irregularities.
**Ignoring Breakpoints** When you play the macro with a _count_ (for example
`50Q`), breakpoints are automatically ignored.


  [!TIP] Add a count of 1 (`1Q`) to play a macro once and still ignore
  breakpoints.
**Shared Keybindings with nvim-dap** If you are using nvim-dap
<https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap>, you can use `dapSharedKeymaps =
true` to set up the following shared keybindings: 1. `addBreakPoint` maps to
`dap.toggle_breakpoint()` outside a recording. During a recording, it adds a
macro breakpoint instead. 2. `playMacro` maps to `dap.continue()` if there is
at least one DAP-breakpoint. If there is no DAP-breakpoint, plays the current
macro-slot instead.

Note that this feature is experimental, since the respective API from nvim-dap
is non-public and can be changed without deprecation notice
<https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/discussions/810#discussioncomment-4623606>.


LAZY-LOADING THE PLUGIN ~

`nvim-recorder` is best lazy-loaded on the mappings for `startStopRecording`
and `playMacro`. However, adding the status line components to `lualine` will
cause the plugin to load before you start or play a recording.

To avoid this, the statusline components need to be loaded only in the
plugin’s `config`. The drawback of this method is that no component is shown
when until you start or play a recording (which you can completely disregard
when you set `clear = true`, though).

Nonetheless, the plugin is pretty lightweight (~400 lines of code), so not
lazy-loading it should not have a big impact.

>lua
    -- minimal config for lazy-loading with lazy.nvim
    {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder",
        dependencies = "rcarriga/nvim-notify",
        keys = {
            -- these must match the keys in the mapping config below
            { "q", desc = " Start Recording" },
            { "Q", desc = " Play Recording" },
        },
        config = function()
            require("recorder").setup({
                mapping = {
                    startStopRecording = "q",
                    playMacro = "Q",
                },
            })
    
                local lualineZ = require("lualine").get_config().sections.lualine_z or {}
                local lualineY = require("lualine").get_config().sections.lualine_y or {}
                table.insert(lualineZ, { require("recorder").recordingStatus })
                table.insert(lualineY, { require("recorder").displaySlots })
    
                require("lualine").setup {
                    tabline = {
                        lualine_y = lualineY,
                        lualine_z = lualineZ,
                    },
                }
        end,
    },
