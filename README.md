## Features
- __Simplified controls__: One key to start and stop recording, a second key for
  playing the macro. Instead of `qa ‚Ä¶ q @a @@`, you just do `q ‚Ä¶ q Q Q`.[^1]
- __Macro Breakpoints__ for easier debugging of macros. Breakpoints can also be
  set after the recording and are automatically ignored when triggering a macro
  with a count.
- __Status line components__: Particularly useful if you use `cmdheight=0` where
  the recording status is not visible.
- __Macro-to-Mapping__: Copy a macro, so you can save it as a mapping.
- __Various quality-of-life features__: notifications with macro content, the
  ability to cancel a recording, a command to edit macros,
- __Performance Optimizations for large macros__: When the macro is triggered
  with a high count, temporarily enable some performance improvements.
- Uses up-to-date nvim features like `vim.notify`. This means you can get
  confirmation notices with plugins like
  [nvim-notify](https://github.com/rcarriga/nvim-notify).

## Setup

### Installation

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder",
	dependencies = "rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- optional
	opts = {}, -- required even with default settings, since it calls `setup()`
},

-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder",
	requires = "rcarriga/nvim-notify", -- optional
	config = function() require("recorder").setup() end,
}
```

Calling `setup()` (or `lazy`'s `opts`) is __required__.

### Configuration

```lua
-- default values
require("recorder").setup {
	-- Named registers where macros are saved (single lowercase letters only).
	-- The first register is the default register used as macro-slot after
	-- startup.
	slots = { "a", "b" },

	mapping = {
		startStopRecording = "q",
		playMacro = "Q",
		-- ‚ö†Ô∏è this should be a mapping you don't normally use in insert mode
		insertPlayMacro = "<C-q>",
		switchSlot = "<C-q>",
		editMacro = "cq",
		deleteAllMacros = "dq",
		yankMacro = "yq",
		-- ‚ö†Ô∏è this should be a string you don't use in insert mode during a macro
		addBreakPoint = "##",
		-- ‚ö†Ô∏è this should be a string you don't use in normal mode during a macro
		insertAddBreakPoint = "<C-e>",
	},

	-- Clears all macros-slots on startup.
	clear = false,

	-- Log level used for any notification, mostly relevant for nvim-notify.
	-- (Note that by default, nvim-notify does not show the levels `trace` & `debug`.)
	logLevel = vim.log.levels.INFO,

	-- If enabled, only critical notifications are sent.
	-- If you do not use a plugin like nvim-notify, set this to `true`
	-- to remove otherwise annoying messages.
	lessNotifications = false,

	-- Use nerdfont icons in the status bar components and keymap descriptions
	useNerdfontIcons = true,

	-- Performance optimzations for macros with high count. When `playMacro` is
	-- triggered with a count higher than the threshold, nvim-recorder
	-- temporarily changes changes some settings for the duration of the macro.
	performanceOpts = {
		countThreshold = 100,
		lazyredraw = true, -- enable lazyredraw (see `:h lazyredraw`)
		noSystemClipboard = true, -- remove `+`/`*` from clipboard option
		autocmdEventsIgnore = { -- temporarily ignore these autocmd events
			"TextChangedI",
			"TextChanged",
			"InsertLeave",
			"InsertEnter",
			"InsertCharPre",
		},
	},

	-- [experimental] partially share keymaps with nvim-dap.
	-- (See README for further explanations.)
	dapSharedKeymaps = false,
}
```

If you want to handle multiple macros or use `cmdheight=0`, it is recommended to
also set up the status line components:

### Status Line Components

```lua
-- Indicates whether you are currently recording. Useful if you are using
-- `cmdheight=0`, where recording-status is not visible.
require("recorder").recordingStatus()

-- Displays non-empty macro-slots (registers) and indicates the selected ones.
-- Only displayed when *not* recording. Slots with breakpoints get an extra `#`.
require("recorder").displaySlots()
```

> [!TIP]
> Use with the config `clear = true` to see recordings you made this session.

Example for adding the status line components to [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim):

```lua
lualine_y = {
	{ require("recorder").displaySlots },
},
lualine_z = {
	{ require("recorder").recordingStatus },
},
```

> [!TIP]
> Put the components in different status line segments, so they have
> a different color, making the recording status more distinguishable
> from saved recordings

## Basic Usage

- `startStopRecording`: Starts recording to the current macro slot (so you do
  not need to specify a register). Press again to end the recording.
- `playMacro`: Plays the macro in the current slot (without the need to specify
  a register), continuing the current macro if at a breakpoint.
- `insertPlayMacro`: Insert-mode version of `playMacro` (useful when a breakpoint
  is hit in insert mode).
- `switchSlot`: Cycles through the registers you specified in the configuration.
  Also show a notification with the slot and its content. (The currently
  selected slot can be seen in the [status line
  component](#status-line-components).)
- `editMacro`: Edit the macro recorded in the active slot. (Be aware that these
  are the keystrokes in "encoded" form.)
- `yankMacro`: Copies the current macro in decoded form that can be used to
  create a mapping from it. Breakpoints are removed from the copied macro.
- `deleteAllMacros`: Copies the current macro in decoded form that can be used to

> [!TIP]
> For recursive macros (playing a macro inside a macro), you can still use
> the default command `@a`.

## Advanced Usage

### Performance Optimizations
Running long macros or macros with a high count, can be demanding on the system
and result in lags. For this reason, `nvim-recorder` provides some performance
optimizations that are temporarily enabled when a macro with a high count is
run.

Note that these optimizations do have some potential drawbacks.
- [`lazyredraw`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'lazyredraw') disables
  redrawing of the screen, which makes it harder to notice edge cases not
  considered in the macro. It may also appear as if the screen is frozen for a
  while.
- Disabling the system clipboard is mostly safe, if you do not intend to copy
  content to it with the macro.
- Ignoring auto-commands is not recommended, when you rely on certain plugin
  functionality during the macro, since it can potentially disrupt those
  plugins' effect.

### Macro Breakpoints
`nvim-recorder` allows you to set breakpoints in your macros, which can be
helpful for debugging macros. Breakpoints are automatically ignored when you
trigger the macro with a count.

__Setting Breakpoints__  
1. *During a recording,* press the `addBreakPoint` key (default: `##`) in normal mode,
    and the `insertAddBreakPoint` key (default: `<C-e>`) in insert mode.
2. *After a recording,* use `editMacro` and add or remove the `##` manually.

__Playing Macros with Breakpoints__  
- Using the `playMacro`/`insertPlayMacro` key, the macro automatically stops at
  the next breakpoint. The next time you press `playMacro`/`insertPlayMacro`, the
  next segment of the macro is played.
- Starting a new recording, editing a macro, yanking a macro, or switching macro
  slot all reset the sequence, meaning that `playMacro` starts from the
  beginning again.

> [!TIP]
> You can do other things in between playing segments of the macro, like
> moving a few characters to the left or right. That way you can also use
> breakpoints to manually correct irregularities.

__Ignoring Breakpoints__  
When you play the macro with a *count* (for example `50Q`), breakpoints are
automatically ignored.

> [!TIP]
> Add a count of 1 (`1Q`) to play a macro once and still ignore breakpoints.

__Shared Keybindings with `nvim-dap`__  
If you are using [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap), you can
use `dapSharedKeymaps = true` to set up the following shared keybindings:
1. `addBreakPoint` maps to `dap.toggle_breakpoint()` outside
a recording. During a recording, it adds a macro breakpoint instead.
2. `playMacro` maps to `dap.continue()` if there is at least one
DAP-breakpoint. If there is no DAP-breakpoint, plays the current
macro-slot instead.

Note that this feature is experimental, since the [respective API from nvim-dap
is non-public and can be changed without deprecation
notice](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap/discussions/810#discussioncomment-4623606).

### Lazy-loading the plugin
`nvim-recorder` can be lazy-loaded, but the setup is a bit more complex than
with other plugins.

`nvim-recorder` is best lazy-loaded on the mappings for `startStopRecording` and
`playMacro`. However, it is still required to set the mappings to the `setup`
call.

However, since using the status line components also results in loading the
plugin. The loading of the status line components can be delayed by setting them
in the plugin's `config`. The only drawback of this method is that no component
is shown when until you start or play a recording (which you can completely
disregard when you set `clear = true`, though).

Nonetheless, the plugin is pretty lightweight (~350 lines of code), so not
lazy-loading it should not have a big impact.

```lua
-- minimal config for lazy-loading with lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-recorder",
	dependencies = "rcarriga/nvim-notify",
	keys = {
		-- these must match the keys in the mapping config below
		{ "q", desc = "ÔÄΩ Start Recording" },
		{ "Q", desc = "ÔÄΩ Play Recording" },
	},
	config = function()
		require("recorder").setup({
			mapping = {
				startStopRecording = "q",
				playMacro = "Q",
			},
		})

			local lualineZ = require("lualine").get_config().sections.lualine_z or {}
			local lualineY = require("lualine").get_config().sections.lualine_y or {}
			table.insert(lualineZ, { require("recorder").recordingStatus })
			table.insert(lualineY, { require("recorder").displaySlots })

			require("lualine").setup {
				tabline = {
					lualine_y = lualineY,
					lualine_z = lualineZ,
				},
			}
	end,
},
```

[^1]: As opposed to vim, Neovim already allows you to use `Q` to [play the last
	recorded macro](https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html#Q). Considering this,
	the simplified controls really only save you one keystroke for one-off
	macros. However, as opposed to Neovim's built-in controls, you can still
	keep using `Q` for playing the not-most-recently recorded macro.
